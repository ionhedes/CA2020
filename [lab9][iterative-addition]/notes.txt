ITERATIVE ADDITION
 - useful for multi-operand addition;
 - useful for multiplication;
 - based on sequential 2-part algorithms:
	- part 1: 
		- stores the current state of the module to be used in the next state;
		- the memory part so we can add multiple times;
	- part 2:
		- updates the current state by adding the current input to it, resulting the next state;
		- the addition part;
