# add all signals in the top module to the wave window
# IMPORTANT: if the top module contains inputs, outputs
#            and any signals that need to be debugged, 
#            then uncomment the next line
# add wave *

# run the simulation until no event takes place anymore
# IMPORTANT: if the simulation needs to be run for a specific
#            number of time units, replace "-all" in the 
#            command bellow with that number
#            Example: <<run 1500>>
# run -all

# ends simulation without leaving the Modelsim environment
# IMPORTANT: if you need to analyze the waveforms or to debugg
#            the design, then comment the next line
# quit -sim
