CONTINUOUS ASSIGNMENTS
- <signal> = <expression>;
- this instruction is continuously executed;
- it is neither blocking, nor non-blocking, it is just executed continuously;
- the left-hand term of the assignment is usually a wire signal;

MODELLING COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS
 - use assign <signal> = <expression> for combinational circuits;
 - use always @(*) blocks - they are executed wherever a signal which appears within the block in a right-hand term changes value;
	- if using assign blocks, make sure they only use BLOCKING assignments;
 - take care at the left-hand term of the assignment - even though we are dealing with combinational logic, we are still using
procedural assignments, hence we need a this signal to be declared as reg;
