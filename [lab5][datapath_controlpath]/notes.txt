DATA PATH
 - performs all the required operations
 - no decisions are made in the data path (e.g. no if/elses)
 - usual components:
	- Arithmetic & Logic Units (ALU);
	- registers, internal buses;
	- multiplexers;

CONTROL PATH
 - makes decisions based on the informations given by the data path;
 - usually designed as a Finite State Machine (FSM);

TRI-STATE DRIVERS
 - you may find yourself in situations where you have a single available line where to feed data into from different sources;
 - tri-state drivers enables multiple lines to be fed into the same line, one at a time, without affecting each other;
	 - if you think about it, there are some resemblances to a multiplexer here;
 - a TSD has 2 inputs, one ENABLE port, and one DATA port, and one output;	
	- when the ENABLE line is HIGH, OUT will have the same value as DATA;
	- when the ENABLE line is LOW, OUT will have the value z - high impedance;

HIGH IMPEDANCE
 - electronics-wie, high impedance means there is little to no current flow through a line;
 - for logic components, this may very well mean that the HI-Z line is not connected to the logic module, enabling
other components to connect to a wire and drive it;
