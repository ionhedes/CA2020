ERROR
 - when the output of a service of a system differs from the expected value;
 - usually, a system fault leads to the apparition of an error;
 - when designing a system, certain fault tolerance and error detection mechanisms are designed to make the computational system secure and stable;

ERROR DETECTION
 - concurrent error detection techniques:
	- act during the operation of the system under test;
	- usual techniques:
		- hardware duplication - two modules of the same type make the same operation at the same time - when two different result are obtained,
					 the error flag is triggered;
		- code redundancy - much like hardware duplication, but on a software level - the invariants of one operation must be the same, no matter how many times
				    we run it;
		- time redundancy;
 - pre-emptive error detection techniques:
	- when detecting an error, suspends the normal operation, puts the system in a debugging mode and tests it;
	- usual techniques:
		- scan - all the storage elements inside the system are rerouted to outside ports, so their value can be monitored;
		- Built-In Self-Test (BIST):
			- facilitates autonomous testing;
			- disconnects the normal inputs from the UUT and hooks it to a Test Pattern Generator;
			- hooks an Output Response Analyzer at the output port, which will generate signatures;
			- a Test Control Unit is responsible for putting the UUT in debug mode;
			- based on the patterns generated by the TPG and the signatures provided by the ORA, the fault can be pinpointed;
	- TPGs:
		- usually binary counters or Linear Feedback Shift Registers (for combinational UUTs, will generate all possible inputs);
	- ORAs:
		- usually implemented using:
			- counters - count how many state transitions there are in the outputs of the UUT, or how many apparitions of one logic value (1x counter/ UUT output);
			- Single Input Signature Registers (a modified type of LFSR) (1x SISR/ UUT output);
		- based on the UUT's outputs, provides a data-lossy signature of fixed size, which describes the operation of the UUT;
		- each different signature can signal a different fault;
		- when there are no faults affecting the UUT, the GOLDEN Signature is returned - happens in dreams and simulations;
